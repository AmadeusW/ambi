_Ambilight clone_

The purpose of this project is to sample the screen data and relay colors to LEDs mounted behind the screen, similarly to Ambilight technology.

My previous attempt used BitBlt and reached 20fps at 1080p and high CPU usage.

This time I'm using [Desktop Duplication API](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/direct3ddxgi/desktop-dup-api) and [Desktop Duplication Sample](https://code.msdn.microsoft.com/windowsdesktop/Desktop-Duplication-Sample-da4c696a) as a starting point. Hence, I am attaching appropriate license in [license.rtf](license.rtf)
